## Employee-Directory

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to  break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:

 * Sort the table by at least one category
 * Filter the users by at least one property.
